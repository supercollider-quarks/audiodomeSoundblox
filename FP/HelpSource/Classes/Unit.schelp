    "In the area of mathematical logic, and computer science known as type theory, a unit type is a type
     that allows only one value (and thus can hold no information). The carrier (underlying set) associated
     with a unit type can be any singleton set."

By returning Unit we are signaling that the function only performs side-effects and does not return anything.
