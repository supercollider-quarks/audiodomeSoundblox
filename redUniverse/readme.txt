work in progress.  happy for any comments or contributions.

note! if you run LINUX, WINDOWS or just prefer to use SwingOSC over Cocoa, you'll need to uncomment all the code in the file RedJWindow.sc and recompile.

some of the examples require additional classes like RedGA, RedLSystem etc.  these are available online at my homepage http://www.fredrikolofsson.com under code->sc

071205 - converted all help.rtf to .html and the examples to .scd
	added the example overview file.
	changed so that RedJWindow is disabled by default.
071031 - update for 3.1
	removed penExt.sc with its strokeColor_ and fillColor_ extensions.
	tiny fix for 150-track_synth.rtf.
071029 - bugfix
	now RedWindow shouldn't crash sc anymore.  it was due to scott's window scoll implemented earlier this autumn.
