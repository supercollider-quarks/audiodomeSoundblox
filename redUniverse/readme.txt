work in progress.  happy for any comments or contributions.

note! if you don't have SwingOSC installed you'll need to remove the file RedJWindow.sc from the classes folder.

some of the examples require additional classes like RedGA, RedLSystem etc.  these are available online at my homepage http://www.fredrikolofsson.com under code->sc

071031 - update for 3.1
	removed penExt.sc with its strokeColor_ and fillColor_ extensions.
	tiny fix for 150-track_synth.rtf.
071029 - bugfix
	now RedWindow shouldn't crash sc anymore.  it was due to scott's window scoll implemented earlier this autumn.
