This toolkit contains class files and help files for using Ambisonics 
spatialisation with SuperCollider3. It may be used with loudspeaker arrays
as well as with headphones, providing binaural rendering with HRTFs. 

Installation: copy Classes into your SCClassLibrary and Help into your SC3 Help folder

Main Classes are: 
	PanAmbi2O/3O		Ambisonics encoding 2nd/3rd order
	DecodeAmbi2O/3O		Ambisonics decoding 2nd/3rd order
	BinAmbi3O		Ambisonics direct decoding to binaural output
	RotateAmbi		Rotation in the Ambisonics domain
	Binaural		Binaural rendering of multichannel audio 
	Room2D/3D		Room simulation (early reflections)
	VirtualRoom		Easy to use class for creation of virtual environments
